# LIN 220 Project for Spring 2020

Finite-state automata as Boolean matrix multiplication (Difficulty: 3, but can be done by a single person)

This project is for the mathematically inclined only. Finite-state automata can be represented as a collection of matrices where all cells are either True or False. These are called Boolean matrices. The process of determining whether a string is accepted by an automaton is equivalent to a specific sequence of matrix multiplications.

This project involves two components:
1. Read up on the connection between automata and Boolean matrix multiplication. The reading materials will be supplied by me, but you should be comfortable reading mathematical notation. [Link for FSA](https://github.com/stonybrook-lin539-f19/main/blob/master/pdf/05_automata/01_automata.pdf), [Link for FSA w/ BMM](https://github.com/stonybrook-lin539-f19/main/blob/master/pdf/05_automata/06_matrix_representation.pdf)
2. Implement code that converts an automaton into its equivalent Boolean matrix representation, as well as an alternative to the .accepts method that uses Boolean matrix multiplication. As part of this, you will have to learn how matrices are handled in Python.

Suggested techniques: memoization for matrix multiplication, the numpy package for representing matrices
